### Cricket Data Analysis – Batting Performance Insights:

### Project Overview:

This project presents a comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) of cricket batting performance data to identify patterns in player output, team strategies, and scoring behavior. The analysis converts raw match data into structured insights that can support performance evaluation, strategic planning, and data-driven decision-making.

### Business Objective:

In modern cricket, performance analytics play a crucial role in team selection and strategy formulation. This project aims to:

Evaluate batting performance variations across teams and players

Identify key factors contributing to higher run scoring

Analyze the relationship between balls faced, strike rate, and total runs

### Approach & Methodology:

Performed initial data exploration to understand dataset structure and quality

Cleaned the dataset by handling missing values and removing outliers

Conducted univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analysis

Applied statistical techniques and visualizations to uncover trends

Interpreted analytical results to generate actionable insights

### Skills Demonstrated:

Data cleaning and preprocessing

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Analytical and critical thinking

Data visualization and storytelling

Translating data findings into business insights

### Tools & Technologies Used:

Python

Pandas & NumPy

Matplotlib & Seaborn

Jupyter Notebook

### Key Insights:

A strong positive correlation exists between balls faced and runs scored

Most batting performances fall within a lower scoring range, with a few consistent high-performing outliers

Teams adopt distinct batting strategies reflected in scoring and strike-rate patterns

Boundary frequency and strike rate significantly influence overall performance

### Outcome:

This project demonstrates my ability to analyze large datasets, extract meaningful performance insights, and communicate findings effectively to both technical and non-technical stakeholders. It highlights a strong foundation in data analytics, problem-solving, and insight-driven storytelling.
